# FDS--Brain-Tumor-Detector-

Brain tumors refer to the abnormal proliferation of cells within or surrounding the brain, specifically they can happen in brain tissue or in nearby locations such as nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain. Tumorâ€™s brain manifest either as benign or malignant diseases.

Brain tumors are among the most critical medical conditions, requiring timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Medical imaging plays a central role in diagnosis of brain tumors. 
This project addresses these limitations by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the detection of brain tumors in MRI images. Using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, this project aims to achieve real-time, precise detection of tumor regions, potentially saving lives through early intervention.
The dataset is acquired from kaggle which contains annotated MRI images of brain tumors and images without tumor. To optimize the training process, diverse sizes and optimizers are used.
